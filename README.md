Data Analysis of Federal Election Commission Database for the 2012 Presidential Election

## Scope

This data analysis project is based on the Federal Election Commission's database regarding the 2012 presidential election and monetary contributions. The data available spans contributor names, occupation and employer, location, and contribution amount. 

Though the presidential primaries ran a field of nearly a dozen candidates, the main focus of this project is to isolate contribution amounts for the top two candidates, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, and to further determine the main contributors (e.g., companies) in relation to prior statistical analyses of such companies' contributions (e.g., the 2008 presidential election). 

## Future Work

This project is intended to be a foundational data analysis for a predictive modeling feature.
